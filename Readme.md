While it's difficult to quantify exactly how much smoking will affect your lifespan, studies have suggested that smokers tend to live shorter lives on average compared to non-smokers. The extent of the impact can depend on factors such as the
> number of cigarettes smoked per day = 10
> the duration of smoking habit = 5 years
> individual health factors. (ignore)

Let's assume:
> The average lifespan of a non-smoker = 80 years
> Smoking 10 cigarettes a day for 5 years.

According to some studies, smoking one cigarette can reduce lifespan by about 11 minutes on average

> Total cigarettes smoked over n years = Cigarettes/day * smoking duration years * 365 days/year
    -> 10 cigarettes/day * 5 years * 365 days/year = 18,250 cigarettes smoked over 5 years
> Total minutes lost due to smoking = Total cigarettes * 11 minutes per cigarette
    -> 18,250 cigarettes * 11 minutes per cigarette = 200,750 minutes lost due to smoking (139.4 days)
